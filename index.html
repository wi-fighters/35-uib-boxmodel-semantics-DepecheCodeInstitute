        THIS IS A HEADER ELEMENT.
        <nav>
            THIS IS MY NAV SECTION. It usually belongs in a header section. The nav feature is only available in HTML5,
            though there are some <abbr title="'Accessible Rich Internet Applications'">ARIA</abbr><a
                href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> role attributes to fill in the gap elsewhere, i.e.
            role&#61;<q>navigation</q>.
        </nav>
        <!-- experiment with aria role attributes work -->
        <!-- maybe create actually functional nav bar? -->

    <h1>
        This page is for my practice using valid semantic elements, with a particular nod to <a
            href="http://mds.is/a11y/"><q>a11y</q></a>. It is important to use built-in HTML elements where possible, as
        they generally offer better code structure and transparency, and often come with cool built-in features like
        native keyboard accessibility. For more on web accessibility, see also <a
            href="https://a11yproject.com/">a11yproject</a>).

    <h2>Knowledge and tools with which I would like to experiment:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>(THIS IS AN UNTITLED LIST. Html Validator taught me that it expects certain kinds of child elements, i.e.
            <q>Zero or more li and script-supporting elements</q>, which meant that I could not just print text after
            the &lt;ul&gt; nor stick it in a &lt;p&gt; element, either)</li>

        <li>proper use of semantic elements, i.e. nav bar, button, aside, article, input labels, etc. <input
                type="checkbox" id="exercise-checklist-1"></li>

        <li>checkboxes, apparently<input type="checkbox" id="exercise-checklist-2">
        </li>

        <li>using descriptive anchor txt (rather than just <q>click me</q>), and notify users when a new tab will be
            opened <input type="checkbox" id="exercise-checklist-3"></li>

        <li>inform users when certain events trigger, i.e. when a new window will be opened, i.e. a new tab/powerpoint,
            etc <input type="checkbox" id="exercise-checklist-4"></li>

        <li>using alt text and titles for contextually important imgs <input type="checkbox" id="exercise-checklist-5">
        </li>

        <li>use meaningful text labels for input fields <input type="checkbox" id="exercise-checklist-6"></li>

        <li>use ARIA attribute values when native HTML features are not available, particular with nested divs <input
                type="checkbox" id="exercise-checklist-7"></li>

        <li>practise using css to style element <input type="checkbox" id="exercise-checklist-8"></li>

        <li>using css for decorative-only images <input type="checkbox" id="exercise-checklist-9"></li>
    </ul>
    <article>
        <h2>THIS IS AN ARTICLE ELEMENT. I added a heading because html validator suggested it. </h2>
        The &lt;article&gt; element identifies a self-contained piece of content which could theoretically be
        distributed to other websites and platforms as a stand-alone unit. The &lt;article&gt; element is a good choice
        to contain entire blog posts, news articles, and similar content... [while it is] functionally similar to using
        &lt;div&gt; elements, and the display and styling work the same. However, using the &lt;article&gt; element
        instead of &lt;div&gt; provides more semantic information to screen readers, search engines, and third-party
        applications.(<a href="https://html.com/tags/article/#ixzz6FuQvYssl">HTML Article Element: Learn When (And

    <!-- place button within div so that I can have an adjacent paragraph telling me about the thing? -->
    <div>
        <button name="native-button-example-only">THIS IS A NATIVE BUTTON INSIDE A DIV</button>
        <ul>
            <li>buttons should be given an accessible name in the &lt;button&gt; element that <q>concisely describes the
                    button's functionality for assistive technologies to access when they parse the document and
                    generate an accessibility tree. Assistive technology then uses the accessibility tree to navigate
                    and manipulate page content</q> (MDN; See <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button">&lt;button&gt;: The Button
                    element</a> for more information).</li>
            <li>native buttons operate with the Enter key and the Spacebar key, which carries through to javaScript
                onclick events.</li>
            <li>to make a button keyboard operable all you need is the onclick event and it works with Enter and
                Spacebar keys (will give this a try after I learn how to combine js with my html/css)</li>
            <li>&lt;div role=”button”&gt; controls don’t work with the Enter AND Spacebar keys or they don’t work with
                the keyboard at all. They’re either skipped right over when tabbing or pressing enter, or spacebar keys
                have no effect because they only have a mouse-dependent onclick JavaScript event.</li>
            <li>do not use a button for a link, as they have separate respective button and link roles.</li>
            <li><q>The reality is that most faux &lt;div&gt; buttons are not keyboard or screen reader accessible at
                    all, and as a developer you’re responsible for implementing the full functionality of the control
                    you use based on its role. So either use native buttons or mimic them completely</q> (Paul J. Adam).

                    Design Survey</a> (Michael Martin), which taught me to consider the contrast between serif headings and sans-serif body text; outlined the most popular typefaces and drew my attention to Helvetica and Lucinda Grande?; suggested a heading:body font-size ratio of 2:1, or to use the Fibonacci sequence for font increases; and suggested a line-height of 1.5em</li>
                <li>Web Designer Depot's <a

                    Rules for Choosing the Perfect Web Typeface</a> (Ben Moss), which suggested that I use the text <q>1Illinois</q> to test typeface choice; to look for typefaces with large and open <q>counters</q>(i.e. the white space in the centre of letters like <q>o</q> and <q>c</q>)</li>
                    <li>pick newer typefaces that are more likely to have more legible characters at both smaller and larger font-sizes</li>

            <sup>2</sup> NB: there is no placeholder text. Although placeholder text might look pretty and compact, it
            is more accessibility-friendly to have clear labels as well as explicit hint-text for a range of reasons:
            place-holder text does not get picked up by translators or screen-readers, it can cause confusion for less
            internet-savvy users and it disappears as people type and so the reference is lost (Eric Bailey; see <a
                href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/06/placeholder-attribute/#top">Don’t Use The Placeholder
                Attribute</a> for more information). See also The A11y's Project article, <a

            <sup>3</sup> While it is generally advised to avoid opening links in new tabs, it is good practice to at
            least notify the user when we do; this can be of help to users with sight and cognitive impairments, and, as
            always, actually helps most users overall. If you do not want to have a notice such as <q>(opens to new
                tab)</q> displayed, consider using a nested tag that is visually hidden for sighted users but still
            notifies screen reader users, such as &lt;span class='screenreader-text'&gt;(Link opens in a new
            tab)&lt;/span&gt; See <a href="https://a11yproject.com/posts/creating-valid-and-accessible-links/">Creating
