            THIS IS MY NAV SECTION. It usually belongs in a header section. The nav feature is only available in HTML5, though there are some <abbr title="'Accessible Rich Internet Applications'">ARIA</abbr>(Accessible Rich Internet Applications)<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> role attributes to fill in the gap elsewhere, i.e. <code>role&#61;<q>navigation</q></code>

        This page is for my practice using valid semantic elements, with a particular nod to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
        href="http://mds.is/a11y/"><q>a11y</q><span class='screenreader-text'>(Link opens in a new tab)</span></a>. It is important to use built-in HTML elements where possible, as they generally offer better code structure and transparency, and often come with cool built-in features like native keyboard accessibility. For more on web accessibility, see also <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://a11yproject.com/">a11yproject</a>).

    <h2>Knowledge and tools with which I would like to experiment:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>(THIS IS AN UNTITLED LIST <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">Html Validator</a> taught me that it expects certain kinds of child elements, i.e.<q>Zero or more li and script-supporting elements</q>, which meant that I could not just print text after the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> nor stick it in a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element, either)</li>

        <li>use of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">Html Validator</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input">CSS Validator</a> <input type="checkbox" id="exercise-checklist-0"></li>

        <li>proper use of semantic elements, i.e. <code>&lt;nav bar&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;input labels&gt;</code>, etc. <input type="checkbox" id="exercise-checklist-1"></li>

        <li>checkboxes, apparently<input type="checkbox" id="exercise-checklist-2"></li>

        <li>using descriptive anchor txt (rather than just <q>click me</q>) <input type="checkbox" id="exercise-checklist-3"></li>

        <li>inform users when certain events trigger, i.e. when a new window will be opened, i.e. a new tab/powerpoint, etc, having regard to visual and screenreader cues <input type="checkbox" id="exercise-checklist-4"></li>

        <li>using alt text and titles for contextually important <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> <input type="checkbox" id="exercise-checklist-5"></li>

        <li>use meaningful text labels for <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> fields <input type="checkbox" id="exercise-checklist-6"></li>

        <li>position <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> fields and <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> properly in relation to their text labels <input type="checkbox" id="exercise-checklist-7"></li>

        <li>use ARIA attribute values when native HTML features are not available, particular with nested <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> <input type="checkbox" id="exercise-checklist-8"></li>

        <h2>THIS IS AN ARTICLE ELEMENT. I added a heading because html validator suggested it.</h2>

        The <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element identifies a self-contained piece of content which could theoretically be distributed to other websites and platforms as a stand-alone unit. The <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element is a good choice to contain entire blog posts, news articles, and similar content... [while it is] functionally similar to using <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements, and the display and styling work the same. However, using the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element instead of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> provides more semantic information to screen readers, search engines, and third-party applications (<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://html.com/tags/article/#ixzz6FuQvYssl">HTML Article Element: Learn When (And Where) To Use It Now</a>).

    <!-- place button within div so that I can have an adjacent paragraph telling me about the thing? -->
    <div>
        <button class="centre__elem" name="native-button-example-only">THIS IS A NATIVE BUTTON INSIDE A DIV</button>
        <ul>
            <li>buttons should be given an accessible name in the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element that <q>concisely describes the button's functionality for assistive technologies to access when they parse the document and generate an accessibility tree. Assistive technology then uses the accessibility tree to navigate and manipulate page content</q> (MDN; See <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button">&lt;button&gt;: The Button
            element</a> for more information)</li>

            <li>native buttons operate with the <code>Enter</code> key and the <code>Spacebar</code> key, which carries through to javaScript onclick events</li>

            <li>to make a button keyboard operable all you need is the onclick event and it works with <code>Enter</code> and <code>Spacebar</code> keys (will give this a try after I learn how to combine js with my html/css)</li>

            <li><code>&lt;div role=”button”&gt;</code> controls don’t work with the <code>Enter</code> AND <code>Spacebar</code> keys or they don’t work with the keyboard at all. They’re either skipped right over when tabbing or pressing <code>Enter</code>, or <code>Spacebar</code> keys have no effect because they only have a mouse-dependent onclick JavaScript event</li>

            <li>do not use a button for a link, as they have separate respective button and link roles</li>

            <li><q>The reality is that most faux <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> buttons are not keyboard or screen reader accessible at all, and as a developer you’re responsible for implementing the full functionality of the control you use based on its role. So either use native buttons or mimic them completely</q> (Paul J. Adam)</li>

            CSS Guidelines I referred to in making this website, included:
            <ul>
                <li>Smashing Magazine's <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-describedby="new-window-0" href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/typographic-design-survey-best-practices-from-the-best-blogs/">Typographic Design Survey</a> (Michael Martin), which taught me to consider the contrast between serif headings and sans-serif body text; outlined the most popular typefaces and drew my attention to Helvetica and Lucinda Grande?; suggested a heading:body font-size ratio of 2:1, or to use the Fibonacci sequence for font increases; and suggested a line-height of 1.5em (contrast with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-describedby="new-window-0" href="https://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html ">Typography in Ten Minutes</a>, which suggests 1.3em)</li>

                <li>Web Designer Depot's <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-describedby="new-window-0" href="https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2015/03/5-rules-for-choosing-the-perfect-web-typeface/">5 Rules for Choosing the Perfect Web Typeface</a> (Ben Moss), which suggested that I use the text <q>1Illinois</q> to test typeface choice; to look for typefaces with large and open <q>counters</q>(i.e. the white space in the centre of letters like <q>o</q> and <q>c</q>), AND: </li>

                <li>pick newer typefaces that are more likely to have more legible characters at both smaller and larger font-sizes</li>

                <li>Many modern guidelines suggest using about 15-25px for online reading (see <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-describedby="new-window-0" href="https://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html ">Typography in Ten Minutes</a>). <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-describedby="new-window-0" href="https://betterwebtype.com/articles/2019/06/16/5-keys-to-accessible-web-typography/ ">5 Keys to Accessible Web Typography</a>, however, suggests web designers avoid using <code>px</code> entirely when determining <code>font-size</code>, but to instead set the html default to <code>font-size: 100%</code>, which then respects the user settings of those "users with limited vision [who] may wish to set the font size much larger than the size chosen by a web designer". Web designers can then customise font sizes responsively for all users with either percentages or relative units elsewhere in the code (<code>em</code> or <code>rem</code>), for example with a @media query.</li>

            <sup>2</sup> Love using a bit of irony to make a point. Although placeholder text might look pretty and compact, it is more accessibility-friendly to have clear labels as well as explicit hint-text for a range of reasons: place-holder text does not get picked up by translators or screen-readers, it can cause confusion for less internet-savvy users and it disappears as people type and so the reference is lost (Eric Bailey; see <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-describedby="new-window-0" href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/06/placeholder-attribute/#top">Don’t Use The Placeholder Attribute</a> for more information).

        <p id="footnote-3">
            <sup>3</sup> While it is generally advised to avoid opening links in new tabs, it is good practice to at least notify the user when we do; this can be of help to users with sight and cognitive impairments, as well as less-savvy users and, as always, actually helps most users overall. If you do not want to have a notice such as <q>(opens to new tab)</q> displayed, consider using visual icons and a <code>&lt;aria-describedby=""&gt;</code> label pointed to a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> nested within a <code>&lt;div hidden&gt;</code> to notify screen-readers.
